    image: ./assets/img/property-chatbot.png
    authors: "A GPT-4o-powered chatbot that helps users explore property listings and gain market insights through natural language queries. It automatically detects intent (listing vs analytics) and generates SQL to return relevant results. Example: “Find a condo in Orchard under $1M with a balcony” or “Which region has the most expensive properties?” Supports listing filtering, regional price analysis, and expandable features like LangChain-based memory and cloud deployment."

    image: ./assets/img/adhd-brain-connectivity.png
    authors: "Built a saliency-based analysis pipeline using an attention-based graph neural network to identify and visualize the most important brain regions distinguishing ADHD from control subjects. Leveraged fMRI connectome data from WiDS Datathon 2025 and visualized results using NetworkX and Nilearn. Evaluated model performance using F1 score and highlighted interpretable neural biomarkers from the trained model."
